Final Project
Title: Urban Evolution: Exploring Urbanization Trends in the United States

# Outline
This project aims to delve into the dynamic processes of urbanization in the United States, specifically focusing on centralization, suburbanization, counter-urbanization, and re-urbanization. The objective is to analyze and visualize how these trends have shaped American cities and suburbs over the years. The project will examine the causes, characteristics, and consequences of each of these urbanization processes, providing insights into their socio-economic and environmental impacts.

# The data
The data for this project will be sourced from U.S. Census data, urban studies research, and environmental impact reports. This includes detailed statistics on population density, urban and suburban growth patterns, economic indicators, and environmental assessments.

> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first. 

Name: U.S. Census Bureau Data

URL:[ Census Data](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/urban-rural.html)

Description: Demographic and economic data related to urbanization trends.


# Method and medium
This project will be brought to life using GIS tools for mapping, Tableau for interactive data visualization, and a storytelling platform like Shorthand to weave the narrative. This combination will enable an engaging and informative digital presentation, effectively communicating the nuances of urbanization in the United States.
