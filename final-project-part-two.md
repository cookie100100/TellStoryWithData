# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project. 

In order to show the evolution of urbanization in the United States, I draw two pictures showing the change of housing from 2010 to 2020 in the US with Tableau. The size and color stands for the number of housing, larger size and darker color means larger number of housing. From the pictures we can see there's a boost in the number of housing within the decade.

> ...include any final thoughts you have here. 

In moving forward with Part III, it's essential to strike a balance between incorporating user feedback and maintaining the core objectives and integrity of the project. Not every suggestion may align perfectly with my vision or the project's constraints, so prioritizing these changes is key. Focus on those modifications that will most significantly enhance the user experience and the overall value of the visualizations. Remember, the goal is to communicate the data effectively and engagingly, making it accessible and informative for my target audience.
