1. original data visualization
Alcohol Consumption
<iframe src="https://data.oecd.org/chart/7l0g" width="860" height="645" style="border: 0" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen="true"><a href="https://data.oecd.org/chart/7l0g" target="_blank">OECD Chart: Alcohol consumption, Total, Litres/capita (aged 15 and over), Annual, 2022</a></iframe>
https://data.oecd.org/healthrisk/alcohol-consumption.htm
I choose this data visualization because of the following 3 points. Firstly, alcohol consumption is a topic with broad social, economic, and health implications, making it relevant to a wide range of audiences, including policymakers, health professionals, educators, and the general public. Secondly, data on alcohol consumption often involves multiple variables, which can test the effectiveness of a data visualization's ability to convey multifaceted information clearly.Thirdly, alcohol consumption rates vary significantly between different countries, cultures, and demographics, offering rich opportunities for comparative analysis. This makes it important for a visualization to represent these differences in a way that is easy to understand and interpret.

2. step-by-step process
2.1 Initial Observations
   Upon first examining the bar chart, I noticed its potential for conveying important data on alcohol consumption but also identified several areas for improvement. The overlapping text and lack of clear context stood out immediately as barriers to comprehension. I realized that the effectiveness of this visualization could be significantly enhanced by addressing these issues. The choice of colors was interesting, and it made me think about the significance assigned to each hue. This initial critique laid the groundwork for my redesign process.
2.2 critique
Usefulness:
The original bar chart visualization's usefulness was ambiguous due to the absence of context and clear labeling. It's essential to tailor the visualization to the audience's needs. If the audience needs to understand alcohol consumption trends for policy-making, public health strategy, or social program planning, the visualization must be tailored to provide that specific information clearly and directly.

Completeness:
The completeness of the visualization was compromised by missing context and data points that could provide comparative insights, such as historical trends or targets. To enhance completeness, the redesign would include all relevant data points and contextual comparisons that support the intended level of understanding.

Perceptibility:
In its initial form, the bar chart's perceptibility was hindered by overlapping labels and a lack of clarity. To improve this, the redesign would use a horizontal layout, clearer labeling, and possibly a different color scheme to enhance the visual distinction between data points.

Truthfulness:
To ensure truthfulness, it's vital that the data represented in the visualization is accurate and that the visual proportions correctly reflect the data values. The redesign would involve verifying the data source and ensuring that the visual representation is proportional and precise.

Intuitiveness:
Given that bar charts are a common form of data display, the chart's intuitiveness was likely adequate for most audiences. However, for an unfamiliar audience, the redesign could include a brief explanation or legend to guide interpretation.

Aesthetics:
The original chart's aesthetics could be considered functional but not engaging. In the redesign, enhancing the aesthetic appeal without sacrificing clarity or accuracy could involve a cleaner layout, a more harmonious color palette, and thoughtful use of whitespace.

Engagement:
Engagement with the data is paramount. The original chart may not have effectively engaged the audience due to its lack of context and visual appeal. The redesign would aim to draw the audience into the data through interactive elements, like tooltips or filters, that allow for exploration and a deeper understanding of the data.
2.3 sketching a new design
Moving on to sketches, I played with various layouts, including horizontal bar charts and even maps, to determine which could best represent the data without losing detail. Through sketching, I saw that a horizontal layout could solve the readability issue with country names, and a map could highlight regional trends.
2.4 Seeking feedback
I sought feedback from classmates. They agreed that the map provides a better visualization effect. But I can user another line chart to show the alcohol consumption over time. Also, highlighting some countries like all europe countries help me address the point of the graph.
2.5 Redesign
2.6 Reflection
Reflecting on this process, I see how each step contributed to a more effective visualization. Critique was crucial in identifying issues, sketching allowed for creative exploration of solutions, feedback provided new perspectives, and the final redesign aimed to balance clarity with depth of information. This journey reinforced the iterative nature of design and the importance of user-centered feedback in creating visualizations that are not just visually appealing but also informative and functional.

In the graph, I visualized the most recent alcohol consumption data for every country on a map. When you put the mouse onto the country, you can see the trend of alcohol consumption over time for this specific country. This graph is more informative than the former one because we can see the location on the map and trend over time.
